  "When": "<p>In 9672 AG Timarch Radovan Karnath weds Lady Harriett of the Bene Gesserit {more backstory here}."

  "Your name was her name": "I send you into the Sisterhood or into the sky. <br>Either will be the end of you.
  <br>Mathilde.<br>What heights your name still soars to even after you're gone.</p>"
  "Rhadovid": "Your son has your eyes. <br>The little mounds of coal warm and aged like a petrol stove of old. 
  He has no warmth for me. <br>I must have fire enough for us all.</p>"
  "Your chosen": "The Knighthawks have taken to wearing your scarf, a gesture you'd have found ridiculous. 
  But it's for our House - and teasing your ghost conjures you in front of me again. 
  They are the finest pilots, soldiers, and engineers in the Imperium."
  "Let us speak plainly.": "I can't trust your shade anymore on this - 
  we've danced in front of the truth for too long. 
  We need to talk about what I've done. <br>Staring into the flames, the wreckage of your crash; 
  your charred remains and the ruin it represented for your family <br>there were but two paths forward.<br>"
  "I did not wish to walk on either path": "One of total obliteration, <br>the other impeded only by my reluctance 
  to carry on for you and those you left behind.</p>"
  "We all hold onto the only parts of you we can find": "I had no designs but to step slowly into your life at first. 
  In the smallest of places. I had no designs.</p>"
  "He loves me": "I did not compel Rhadovan. That came with time. Eventually he overcame my misgivings, 
  and professed unworthiness. You'd have hated me for saying those things about myself, and you'd have been half right for it."
  "Would you still recognize me?": "Does he love me because of my chance given gifts, 
  or what gifts I've been taught.
  I can no longer separate who I was and who I now am."
  "Suffering in silence is a gift": "Bury this guilt, carry it now, and always. 
  <br>My quiet is for our children. <br>I will be *whatever* they need me to be."
